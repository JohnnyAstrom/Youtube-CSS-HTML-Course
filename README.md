**About the Project**
This project is a hands-on implementation of a tutorial series by SuperSimpleDev that teaches essential HTML and CSS skills for creating complex websites. Through the course, I gained practical experience by following along with lessons covering HTML basics, CSS properties, layout techniques (including CSS Grid and Flexbox), and styling elements. This project showcases my understanding of web development fundamentals and my ability to apply these techniques in practice.

This project is based on the work of SuperSimpleDev. While the structure and code closely follow the tutorial, completing this project helped me solidify my understanding of the tools and technologies used. Full credit to SuperSimpleDev for the tutorial.
